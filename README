## Summary

Nethook is a daemon that runs scripts when network interfaces change state.

## Usage

When a network interface goes down, the following locations are checked for scripts. If they exist and are executable, they are run.

/etc/nethook/ifup.d/*
/etc/nethook/ifup-$DEVICE

Similarly, when a network interface goes up, the following locations are checked for scripts to run.

/etc/nethook/ifdown.d/*
/etc/nethook/ifdown-$DEVICE

Prior to running the scripts, nethook parses /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-$DEVICE if it exists and makes the variables set in it available in the scripts' environment.

## Requirements

Nethook was tested on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, aka RHEL5, but it should work on any similar distributions which

-  Place network interface configuration in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-*
-  When NICs change state, signal processes that called netreport

Nethook requires the following Perl modules, which are available in the EPEL repository.

-  perl-App-Daemon
-  perl-IO-Interface
-  perl-Log-Log4perl
-  perl-YAML

## Installation

1.  Move nethook to /usr/sbin/nethook
2.  Move init/sysv to /etc/init.d/nethook
3.  Run `chkconfig nethook on`
4.  Run `service nethook start`
